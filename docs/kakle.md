# Kakle

When working on big or small teams, there comes a time when one of your team members adds a frontend dependency, adds code that requires database migration, or just adds a patch that simply requires you to run a command. `kakle` does exactly this. If some file is changed, run a command. If a commit message contains a tag, run a command. If you don't want to automatically run commands, you can just get a reminder that you should do it your self. `kakle` can be summarized as `If Commit, Then That`.
